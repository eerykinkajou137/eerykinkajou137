## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Callum Govender, an enthusiastic 18-year-old currently diving into the world of web development. I'm in the second month of the CodeSpace Full Stack Development program, where I'm honing my skills and passion for coding. I'm excited to explore the limitless possibilities of tech and bring creative ideas to life!

I have a solid foundation in CSS and Tailwind, and I'm starting to get comfortable with JavaScript. I'm eager to deepen my knowledge and build more complex and dynamic web applications as I continue to learn and grow in this field.
